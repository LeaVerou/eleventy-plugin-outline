# eleventy-plugin-outline (WIP)

**A work in progress**

This plugin is the swiss army knife when it comes to creating outlines in Eleventy,
but itâ€™s also quite opinionated in how it does things.
It still affords plenty of customization, but via extensibility rather than configuration.

Features include:
- [x] Numbering of headings and figures
- [x] Render an outline for a whole document or just a page, using your own template
- [ ] Create cross-references to headings, figures, tables, etc.
