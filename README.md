# eleventy-plugin-outline (WIP)

This plugin is the swiss army knife when it comes to creating outlines in Eleventy,
but itâ€™s also quite opinionated in how it does things.
It affords customization via extensibility, rather than configuration.

Features include:
- Numbering of headings and figures
- Render an outline for a whole document or just a page, using your own template
- Create cross-references to headings, figures, tables, etc.
